# Automated-Instagram-Messages-Using-Python-Software


we will see how to send a single message to any number of people. We just have to provide a list of users. We will use selenium for this task.

Packages needed
Selenium: It is an open-source tool that automates web browsers. It provides a single interface that lets you write test scripts in programming languages like Ruby, Java, NodeJS, PHP, Perl, Python, and C#, among others. I personally prefer Python as itâ€™s very easy to write code in python. A browser-driver then executes these scripts on a browser-instance on your device. To install this module run this command into your terminal.
pip install selenium
webdriver-manager: It provides a way to automatically manage drivers for different browsers. To install this module run this command into your terminal.
pip install webdriver-manager
ChromeDriver: ChromeDriver is a separate executable that Selenium WebDriver uses to control Chrome.
Google Chrome.
